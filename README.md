# Block Rule List

This is a content blocking rule manager used in Opacity Browser.  
We use [tracker-blocklists](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-blocklists) provided by DuckDuckGo, plus some additional rules. And to parse the rule list, [TrackerRadarKit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/TrackerRadarKit) is used.
